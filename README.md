This is a script to make the evaluation for a DIY spectrometer. 
for this to work all three codes need to be in the same folder. Plus there has to be a folder called photos, within that folder is another folder called originals.
in the originals you can load all your images, you'd like to analyze.

It is based on https://github.com/kousheekc/DIY-Spectrometer-Analyser/tree/master this code from kousheekc. 


THIS IS A VERY INACCURATE CODE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO.
